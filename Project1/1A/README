(THREE SLIP DAY)




The tarball lab0-604057669.tar.gz includes lab1a.c, Makefile, and README.
    lab1a.c: main source code of the program.
    Makefile: build the lab1a executable, delete all makefile-created files to return the directory to its just installed state, and build the distribution tarball.
    README: this file which describes overall lab.



General impression: I started this lab late and am also stuck on shell part for a long time.
