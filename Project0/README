The tarball lab0-604057669.tar.gz includes lab0.c, Makefile, backtrace.png, breakpoint.png, and README.
    lab0.c: main source code of the program.
    Makefile: build the lab0 executable, runs a quick smoke-test on whether or not the program seems to work, delete all makefile-created files to return the directory to its just installed state, and build the distribution tarball.
    backtrace.png: a screenshot of showing a segfault and associated stack-trace.
    breakpoint.png: a screenshot of showing a breakpoint and variable inspection.
    README: this file which describes overall lab.



In Makefile, there are smoke-test cases in the check target.
There are 8 smoke-test cases in total:
      4 of them is checking if lab0 functions properly with appropriate arguments given.
      1 of them is checking if lab0 exits correctly with exit code of 1 when unrecognized arguments are given.
      1 of them is checking if lab0 exits correctly with exit code of 2 when unable to open input file.
      1 of them is checking if lab0 exits correctly with exit code of 2 when unable to open input file.
      1 of them is checking if lab0 exits correctly with exit code of 2 when caught and received SIGSEGV.

Thus, overall it checks whether 'lab0' exits with correct exit code in different cases. The correct exit codes are given below:
      0 ... copy successful
      1 ... unrecognized argument
      2 ... unable to open input file
      3 ... unable to open output file
      4 ... caught and received SIGSEGV




General impression: I think this lab0 is doable but still it took much more time to finish than what I guessed before I had started.
